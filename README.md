This program is simply for me to learn how to work with
binary trees in C++, in the form of Huffman coding.

The goal i decided to go for was: A console based application
that will read a string, perform huffman coding, then output the binary tree in console,
binary code of coding string, and then decoding this binary code to string inversely.

PS. programm was written without good design style, without headers files and so on.
